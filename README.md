Inforation of captured packets are stored in /var/shanilog.txt. The log is human-readable, but
considering the quantity, we provide a filter to help locating information you are interested in.

    shailter dstmac FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF # filtering packets whose destination hardware address is
    FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF
    shailter raw "secret" # filtering packets containing the string "secret"
